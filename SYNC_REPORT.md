# Repository Sync Report

Branch: sync/20250815-nl

Objectives:
- Align local main with origin/main (byte-for-byte)
- Rebase working changes onto latest origin/main
- Make local checks green: backend tests, FE lint/types, docker build, quality gate
- Ensure CI workflows exist for required checks

Key actions:
- Completed interactive rebase; resolved conflicts in: .cursor/rules, .github/workflows/release-please.yml, .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md, docker-compose.test.yml, .github/workflows/codeql.yml, .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Local main fast-forwarded to origin/main
- Generated divergence logs and local diff

Artifacts:
- reports/divergence.log
- reports/local_changes.diff
- reports/local_verify/*.log

Local verification results:
- backend-test-fast: PASS
- fe-lint: PASS
- fe-types: PASS
- docker-ci: PASS
- quality-gate: PASS (non-blocking thresholds; see reports/quality_summary.md)

CI readiness:
- Workflows present with jobs: backend-tests, frontend-tests, security, docker-build, quality-gate
- CodeQL workflow enabled (push/PR/schedule + manual)

Next steps:
- Open PR and monitor required checks; close stale PRs superseded by this sync if any


Finalization: local main equals origin/main; PR #44 merged; required checks green; sync branch deleted.
